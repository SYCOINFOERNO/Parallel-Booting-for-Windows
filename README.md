# Parallel-Booting-for-Windows
This Repository will help you install a Linux distro of your choice.                                                                                                                                                          


1) Choose an Operating System. Example Mint, Ubuntu, etc..                                                                                            
2) Install the .iso file of that OS distro.                                                                           
3) Grab a usb flash drive of more than 8GB and flash the .iso file.                                                                       
4) For this you can use a software called BalenaEtcher and procedue to do the flash.                                                                        
5) Once that is done keep the flash drive aside.                                                                                                
6) Now, if you have more that 500Gb storage then in case you dont need to utilize all of it, you can keep aside some of the storage for linux.                                                      
7) Incase you dont have that much space then you can use a Virtual Machine.                                                                         
8) If step 7 is true then go to next step; if not contine this "Guide:- https://github.com/SYCOINFOERNO/Virtual-Machine-Installation-for-Linux".                                          
9) Using DiskPart in windows which can be accessed by pressing "Win+x --> K".                                                              
10) Now, select the volume you want to shrink and right click and select shrink volume and allocate the storage you want to give to your linux system.
11) !!IMPORTANT STEP!!  IF YOU HAVE BITLOCKER TURNED ON THEN TURN IT OFF OTHERWISE IT WILL LEAD TO A LOT OF PROBLEMS.                                                                                            
12) Now, Shut down you computer and plug in your flash drive.
13) And mostly it will boot into the Installation media.
14) once it happens, follow the installation instrutions.
15) And BOOM you have linux.
